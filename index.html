        <h3>What is NorthTek™?</h3><br />
        <p>NorthTek™ is a problem solving system for inertial systems. NorthTek™ is the combination of a 
        programming language, a compiler, an interactive command line interpreter, a database, and a real time
        computation engine. The compiler-interpreter-execution environment provides an interface into both
        the database and the compute engine. The combination of all these elements is the NorthTek™
        Programming System. The name NorthTek™ came from the underlying components of the system,
        namely a Navigation engine, the Forth programming language and Technical capability, with a bit of
        poetic license taken with spelling. NorthTek™ allows an application or integration engineer the ability
        to tailor a NorthTek™ equipped sensor to the operating environment of a product, even in real time as
        conditions change with the device in which it is incorporated. This gives the user the ability to solve
        attitude and heading reference problems that previously could not be solved or could only be solved
        with expensive or difficult to develop solutions.</p>

        <h3>How is NorthTek™ Used?</h3><br />
		<p>NorthTek™ is used by downloading a program into the sensor and having that program implement
        custom algorithms in the sensor with tightly coupled access to the sensing environment. That program
        then allows the sensor output to be both correct and timely for the application environment. This
        paradigm breaks the normal sensor paradigm where the sensor merely streams raw data and it is up to
        the integration system to filter and process the raw data to extract the needed information.
        NorthTek™ can be used, for example, to limit the sensor output to only specific conditions which may
        be of interest to the system, or to switch from one set of operating parameters or calibration to another
        based on changing conditions. This capability does not exist in the traditional streaming sensor
        paradigm.</p><br /><br />
